This is a spike to see if [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is capable of doing everything that we need it to. The main body of code is in src/EnrollmentChart.js, with the associated data in src/data.js and the calling of the component in src/App.js. There are also a couple of superficial styles in src/index.css.

In order to see the chart in action run `yarn start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
